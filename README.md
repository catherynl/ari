#Ari

Ari is an immersive experience that combines music, technology, and art. It offers users the chance to explore a fun, cool, and intuitive way to interact musically with pieces of a virtual environment. Ari would ideally be made available at an indoor theme park or other exploratory setting for users with little prior VR exposure to enjoy this one-time ride experience.
